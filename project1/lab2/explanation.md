1. Floating point representation error
 - because need to be represented in IEEE-754 floating point
 - allowed for only 7 decimal digit significant (24 bits)

2. Fraction with denominator not power of 2
 - truncation of mantissa (to a fixed number of bit)
 - we can only get approximation of those values
 - sometimes the error cancel each other out
